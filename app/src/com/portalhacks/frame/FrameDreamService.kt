/**
 * Thin trampoline screensaver.
 *
 * Portal's ambient/dream manager kills an interactive in-dream UI within ~1s
 * (DREAM_FINISHED), which made a self-hosted slideshow flicker in and out. So
 * instead of rendering inside the dream, we use the dream purely as the
 * "device went idle" trigger: launch the full-screen interactive
 * [SlideshowComposeActivity] (which renders and handles swipe/tap reliably) and exit
 * the dream. The Activity keeps the screen on, so nothing loops; its Close control removes
 * the independent task and returns to the app that was visible before the device idled.
